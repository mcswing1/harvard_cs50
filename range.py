# Go through the list one element at a time and for each element, call that element "i"

#for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
#While the loop above is good for a few elements, for a range of a hundred or thousand numbers, use the built-in function "range"
for i in range(6):
    # Print out the value of "i" for each iteration of the loop
    print(i)
